You will be using your laptop tp run and build Singularity images. You should ensure that you have Singularity installed before you come along to the course. Instructions for installing Singularity on Windows (within WSL2) can be found on the BIOIN wiki space at:

[https://aa-gen.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/BIOIN/pages/7068589/Setting+up+WSL+on+Windows+10+for+Singularity+container+development](Setup Singularity on Windows, BIOIN)

If you are having problems installing Singularity, members of the BIOIN team will be available to help on the morning before the course starts (Wed 21 June 2023).
